The Challenge
PrecisionAuto faces high operational inefficiencies and instability:
1. High Defect Rate (Quality): Current scrap/rework rate is 3.5% of total production, significantly higher than the industry best practice of <1.5\%.
2. Unpredictable Downtime (Efficiency): Unplanned machine breakdowns lead to erratic production lead times and high maintenance costs.

Design a three-year implementation strategy for adopting Smart Factory technologies to reduce the defect rate to under 1.0% and decrease unplanned machine downtime by 60%.
